My name is Elis (SA0Ì¸BSE) and I currently live and work in Stockholm, Sweden.

* ./about/good-with/
I've quite much experience working with PHP backends as well as some server
maintenance over the years, the levels of responsibility at different
work-places have been different.

Through the past many years I've been using several Linux distributions over
extended (at least a few years) periods of time. Distros I've been using
includes for example: NixOS, ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Gentoo, CentOS, etc.

I've also have much experience with designing, building and running big
web-services used by a lot of people.

I have experience of working with micro-services and as well monoliths.

I'm also fluent in both English and Swedish.

 - I enjoy doing things with NixOS the most, it's an incredible system that I
   always prefer to do everything with.
 - I also enjoy using Emacs, I use Emacs for more or less everything.
 - I enjoy to go to conferences like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress][CCC]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM][FOSDEM]].
