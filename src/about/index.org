My name is Elis (SA4BSE) and I currently live in Arvika, Sweden and work

:CUSTOM_ID: good-with
:END:

I've quite much experience working with PHP backends as well as some server
maintenance over the years, the levels of responsibility at different
work-places have been different.

Through the past many years I've been using several Linux distributions over
extended (at least a few years) periods of time. Distros I've been using
includes for example: NixOS, ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Gentoo, CentOS, etc.

I've also have much experience with designing, building and running big
web-services used by a lot of people.

I have experience of working with micro-services and as well monoliths.

I'm also fluent in both English and Swedish.
