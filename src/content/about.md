My name is Elis (SA4BSE) and I currently live in Arvika, Sweden and
work remotely in Stockholm, Sweden.

## ./about/good-with/

I've quite much experience working with PHP backends as well as some
server maintenance over the years, the levels of responsibility at
different work-places have been different.

Through the past many years I've been using several Linux
distributions over extended (at least a few years) periods of
time. Distros I've been using includes for example: NixOS, ArchLinux,
Ubuntu, Gentoo, CentOS, etc.

I've also have much experience with designing, building and running
big web-services used by a lot of people.

I have experience of working with micro-services and as well
monoliths.

I'm also fluent in both English and Swedish.

## ./about/enjoyment/

- I enjoy a variety of things outside of tech and IT.
- In the past, I often attended conferences like
  [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress)
  and [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM), which were great
  opportunities to meet people and learn new things.
- I still appreciate NixOS and open source, but my interests have
  broadened over time.
