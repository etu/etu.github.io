I'm a developer and free software enthusiast. This page has historically
mostly been a digital contact card so people can go here to find me in other
locations on the internet. Further on it may contain blog articles about
my computer-related journey trough life to get to where I am now and the
systems I use today. A lot has changed over the years, mostly for good.

Things I enjoy to do and talk about:

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
- Computer conferences such as [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) and [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM).
- Building a web of trust with GPG/PGP

If you wish to contact me, check the contact section on the [about](/about)-page.
