Welcome! This page has mostly served as a digital contact card so
people can find me elsewhere on the internet. Over time, it may
include blog articles about my journey and interests, which have
changed and broadened over the years.

Some tags from my blog:
- [NixOS](/tags/nixos/)
- [Linux](/tags/linux/)
- [Veganism](/tags/veganism/)
- [Health](/tags/health/)
- [Ethics](/tags/ethics/)

Things I enjoy:
- I used to attend conferences like
  [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress)
  and [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) quite often,
  which was a great way to meet people and learn new things.
- My interests have broadened beyond tech and IT, but I still
  appreciate open source and community efforts.

If you wish to contact me, check the contact section on the
[about](/about)-page.
