type: cubing
cubeSize: 4
algorithms:
  # - name: Template algorithm
  #   notation:
  #     full: R U R' U'
  #     short: R U R' U'     # Optional: to show easier to remember version like "sexy" instead of full notation

  #     This is a template algorithm entry. Replace with actual algorithm data.
  #   animCube:
  #     initMove: ""         # Recommended: Set to x2 to get yellow side on top
  #     buttonBar: 1         # Default: show button bar (1) or not (0)
  #     buttonHeight: 25     # Default: height of buttons in px
  #     speed: 10            # Default: animation speed
  #     initRevMove: '#'     # Default: '#' means no reverse initial move and is default

  - name: Parity for 4x4 and other even cubes
    notation:
      full: (r2 R2 U2 r2 R2 u2 r2 R2 u2) U2
    description: |
      This parity algorithm is used to flip the entire edge between top
      front and top back side. This can only occur on even-layered cubes
      and works on any size of even layered cube.
    animCube:
      initMove: x2

  - name: Parity for 4x4 and bigger cubes (even or odd)
    notation:
      full: (r2 B2 U2 l U2 r') (U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l') (B2 r2)
    description: |
      This parity algorithm is used to resolve the single edge flip
      when two edges next to each other needs to switch places. This
      can occur on 4x4x4 and bigger cubes, both even and odd
      layered cubes.
    animCube:
      initMove: x2
