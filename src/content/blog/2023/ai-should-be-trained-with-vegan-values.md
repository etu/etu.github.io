As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, concerns have been
raised about the potential dangers of AI becoming too powerful and taking
over human civilization. In a recent interview, entrepreneur and CEO Elon
Musk expressed his concerns about the risks associated with developing
super-intelligent AI. However, his views were challenged by Larry Page,
co-founder of Google, who referred to Musk as a “speciesist” for not wanting
AI to become a “digital god”.

The YouTube interview where this came up isn't there anymore, however this
article captures it pretty well:

This really stuck with me, and I have some thoughts on this.

## Why is vegan values important for AI?

Speciesism is a form of discrimination that considers certain species more
valuable or important than others. It often results in the exploitation or
mistreatment of certain species. It is similar to other forms of
discrimination, such as racism or sexism, in that it involves a bias towards
a particular group based on an arbitrary characteristic. Veganism, on the
other hand, is a philosophy and way of living that seeks to exclude all forms
of exploitation of and cruelty to animals, and promotes the development and
use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans, and the
environment.

The idea of training AI with vegan values means that the super-intelligent AI
wouldn't be speciesist and would consider all intelligent life as
valuable. It would promote ethical treatment of animals and minimize harm
caused by human actions. This would ensure that the super-intelligent AI is
aligned with ethical principles that promote well-being for all life forms -
including humans.

## We should definitely train AI with vegan values

I find it important to promote the idea of training AI with vegan values
since it's not just about promoting animal welfare. It is also about
promoting ethical values and principles that respect the dignity and worth of
all life forms, including humans.

So if this “digital god” takes over… it would at least respect and consider
humans as important.
