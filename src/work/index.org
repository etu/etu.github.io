As a work life experience I mostly have been working with PHP and other
web-related technologies. For the past 5 years I've been mostly focusing on
the backend part of web development. Such as handling big data sets.

I've also got experience with maintaining servers, networks, load balancing,
databases, sshd, web servers among other things you need for a big website
to scale and work well.
