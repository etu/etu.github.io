As a work life experience I mostly have been working with PHP and other
web-related technologies. Since 2014 been focusing on backend development.

I've also got experience with maintaining servers, networks, load balancing,
databases, sshd, web servers among other things you need for a big website to
scale and work well.

** 203 Brands AB / Shopello AB (2014-04 -- 2016-04)

This was more a pure backend position than my previous roles. We designed
APIs for external users where we had to consider API versioning,
compatibility and communication to these external users about breakage. We
also managed huge data imports of product data to make available in the API.
