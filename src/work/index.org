I mostly do PHP and other Web-things for living. I have been working at
Tailor Store, South Pole, Webhallen a few other places. I like to play around
with new web-technology like canvas, HTML5, and other things in the same
spectrum. I also maintain servers, networks, loadbalancing, databases and
other services you need for a website to work.
