I'm a developer and free software enthusiast. This page has historically
mostly been a digital contact card so people can go here to find me in other
locations on the internet. But further on it will contain blog articles about
my computer-related journey trough life to get to where I am now and the
systems I use today. A lot has changed over the years, mostly for good.

Things I enjoy to do and talk about:
 - [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] & [[https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Emacs-Meetup/][Stockholm Emacs Meetup]]
 - Computer conferences such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress][CCC]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM][FOSDEM]].
 - Building a web of trust with GPG/PGP

If you wish to contact me, check the contact section on the [[file:about/index.org][about]]-page.
