<p>For about 9 years, I&rsquo;ve been a customer of Google G-Suite, using it
for email, file storage, and photos. I&rsquo;ve never fully trusted them,
however I have always claimed the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a paying customer, I hope that they mine my data less than they
do for free users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty in that sentence. Words like <strong>hope</strong> and
<strong>less</strong> aren&rsquo;t exactly reassuring, and there&rsquo;s no proof it&rsquo;s actually
the case either. With a recent price increase warning at renewal time
and the current state of politics between the EU and USA, I decided to
switch to an EU provider.</p>
<p>Here’s how the journey actually went.</p>
<h2 id="1-planning-and-preparation">1. Planning and Preparation</h2>
<p>At first, it seemed overwhelming. I had multiple email accounts,
shared folders, and years of accumulated emails and photos. With one
of the accounts belonging to a parent who isn&rsquo;t always tech-savvy, I
wanted to ensure the transition would be smooth for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I needed to assess:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many accounts I had</li>
<li>How much data was stored</li>
<li>Which features needed to migrate</li>
<li>What could stay behind</li>
</ul>
<p>Proton&rsquo;s tools for mail import, combined with manually syncing files
(via Google Takeout and upload to Proton Drive), made the transition
manageable. Proton&rsquo;s migration interface for email, calendar, and
contacts is excellent.</p>
<h2 id="2-mail--calendar--contacts-migration">2. Mail / Calendar / Contacts Migration</h2>
<p>Migrating mail from Google to Proton was straightforward with the
built-in import tools. I synced emails using a one-time import through
Proton Easy Switch, and it worked well.</p>
<p>It took some time, especially with large mailboxes, but it just works.</p>
<h2 id="3-files-and-photos">3. Files and Photos</h2>
<p>Files and photos required more work. Google Takeout was useful for
export, but it comes with quirks:</p>
<p>Photos export with separate JSON metadata files containing timestamps
and location data, rather than embedding them in the actual images.</p>
<p>Without correcting EXIF metadata, Proton Photos would display
incorrect dates.</p>
<p>I wrote a script to read the exported JSON and embed the correct
timestamps and GPS data back into the photos before uploading. This
ensured Proton Photos would index most of them correctly.</p>
<p>With Proton Drive syncing files and photos locally first, uploads and
indexing afterward worked smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="4-dns-and-cut-over">4. DNS and Cut-over</h2>
<p>Once everything was migrated and tested, I pointed my domain’s DNS
records (MX, SPF, DKIM) to Proton. The cutover was seamless—mail flow
switched over quickly once DNS propagated.</p>
<p>Google G Suite stopped delivering mail at that point, as expected.</p>
<h2 id="5-closing-google-g-suite">5. Closing Google G Suite</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things got messy compared to how most subscriptions
behave.</p>
<p>If you have a gym membership for a year and cancel it after half a
year, one of two things would happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Most likely) You get to use the membership for the remaining period
of time, you don&rsquo;t get any money back.</li>
<li>(Less likely) You don&rsquo;t get to use the membership for the remaining
period of time, but you do get the money back.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Google decided to go the third route:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cancel, they lock you out right away even though you&rsquo;ve already
pre-paid for a period of time. And they don&rsquo;t give you any money
back.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they do warn about it. So I pressed on and canceled right
after everything was moved.</p>
<h2 id="6-preserving-cloud-identities">6. Preserving Cloud Identities</h2>
<p>When you cancel a G Suite subscription, you&rsquo;ll probably still want to
keep your Google account for things like YouTube, Play Store, Sign in
with Google, and other services.</p>
<p>In the admin console, you can add the <strong>Cloud Identity Free</strong> license
type and assign it to all users.</p>
<p>This allows you to keep the account but with zero storage for
<strong>Email</strong>, <strong>Drive</strong>, and <strong>Photos</strong>. This creates a catch-22: I can&rsquo;t
access Gmail to delete my emails, so they remain there and I&rsquo;m over my
storage limit.  But it&rsquo;s not actually a problem for my use case.</p>
<p>You can still access Google Drive, which is great for viewing shared
files and folders owned by other users.</p>
<p>My Sign in with Google, Play Store, and other services still work,
which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="7-final-thoughts">7. Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, the migration was less risky and more straightforward than
expected once broken down into steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail migrated reliably</li>
<li>Files and photos moved with mostly correct metadata</li>
<li>Accounts kept their identity without losing Play purchases or Google
login capabilities</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="71-proton-docs-and-sheets">7.1 Proton Docs and Sheets</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate not to be a demanding user of Google Docs or Sheets.  I
actually prefer Proton Docs—you can type markdown syntax and it
formats automatically, which is lovely.</p>
<p>Proton Sheets is more limited, and I&rsquo;m a heavier user there for
personal data tracking. Some of my imported sheets needed adjustments.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll adapt. It&rsquo;ll take some time, but it&rsquo;s manageable.</p>
<h3 id="72-my-recommendation">7.2 My Recommendation</h3>
<p>Migrate first, then cancel G Suite. If you want to preserve your
Google account identity, convert to Cloud Identity Free after
canceling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cleanest path I found. It left me with Proton for daily use
and a preserved Google identity for the services I still need.</p>
