<p>This is a sneak peak into the future 20.09 release of NixOS.</p>
<p>The PHP packaging ecosystem in NixOS has been in a quite sad state for a long
time. Partly because of the lack of people caring about PHP in Nix, but also
that PHP is a bit weird when it comes to packaging.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-php-before-nixos-2009">State of PHP before NixOS 20.09</h2>
<p>Due to the lack of ability to do clever things like the python community does
with =withPackages= to compose a package with the dependencies you need we
have defaulted to provide a huge default package to accommodate all needs.</p>
<p>We have been quite bad at accommodating all needs though…</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give a few examples.</p>
<p>PHP in NixOS has defaulted to including for example the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>curl</code></li>
<li><code>pdo_mysql</code></li>
<li><code>pdo_odbc</code></li>
<li><code>pdo_pgsql</code></li>
<li><code>imap</code></li>
<li><code>ldap</code></li>
</ul>
<p>… among many other modules. Some of these are quite convenient to get (such
as database related extensions). But some of these are totally unreasonable
to have as default in a distribution. But due to the nature of Nix and the
lack of easily extending PHP we have just coped with having a huge
distribution of PHP.</p>
<p>Also, at the same time we have lacked some other notable extensions in the
default build, such as <code>opcache</code>, without recompiling PHP…</p>
<p>So users migrating from another distribution, for example anything based on
Debian that defaults to having opcache enabled by default will see a drastic
performance penalty by migrating to NixOS. This can be fixed by enabling the
opcache flag for the build and recompile the entire PHP package. How fun…</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-a-better-php-packaging-ecosystem">The road to a better PHP packaging ecosystem</h2>
<p>Real work and thought into this project started in December 2019 when I had a
chat with Grahamc about a packaging in PHP. And he referred me to talk to a
another person that was doing a modular PHP setup. I got some notes and
started to work on it but it proved to be a huge project. So it kinda died
off there.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/79377">PHP: buildEnv function for additional config on the CLI SAPI</a> happened
that made it easier to extend PHP as it was, and I was really happy to see
this work happening since it really followed along some of the things I
wanted to do. So I set off and made <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/82348">PHP extensions as packages</a> to package
almost all PHP extensions as separate packages. With this it would be easier
to pull in official PHP extensions into the PHP package without the need to
recompile it.</p>
<p>This led to the end game to have a really small PHP as base, but it&rsquo;s easy to
extend. This led me to the path to start with <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/82794">PHP: Make the default package
more sane</a> of the first iteration.
But it proved to be a big project, so <a href="https://github.com/talyz/">@talyz</a> and
me teamed up with to bring this project to what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<p>This finally ended up as the following pull request: <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/83896">PHP: Make the default
package more sane (v3)</a>. That
now has been merged into nixpkgs. This PR change the entire PHP ecosystem
in NixOS.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-php-in-nixos-in-2009-and-beyond">State of PHP in NixOS in 20.09 and beyond</h2>
<p>The things we have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have made a really small PHP as base</li>
<li>But we extend it by default to contain a bigger set of packages to not for
break our users.</li>
<li>We provide almost all upstream extensions and a bunch of 3rd party ones for
inclusion into your PHP.</li>
<li>We have written the initial documentation for how to use PHP on Nix.</li>
<li>We have enabled running tests for every upstream extension of PHP by
default. And we do it when we build each extension in a sandbox separate
from each other (This has some issues though).</li>
<li>We have added =opcache= as a default extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>So hereby I now make the following claim:</p>
<p>NixOS now have the best packaging of PHP on any distribution of any operating
system out there when it comes to the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity for minimalist install</li>
<li>Flexibility to select exactly which extensions you want</li>
</ul>
<p>Example to build a PHP with exactly the extensions I want:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-nix" data-lang="nix"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">php</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">withExtensions</span> <span class="p">({</span> <span class="n">enabled</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="p">}:</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">all</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">[</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">curl</span> <span class="n">imagick</span> <span class="n">opcache</span> <span class="n">redis</span> <span class="n">pdo_mysql</span> <span class="n">pdo</span> <span class="n">mysqlnd</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">openssl</span> <span class="n">posix</span> <span class="n">sodium</span> <span class="n">sockets</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">])</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And since Nix can be used to build Docker images and be used for deployments,
this becomes a damn powerful packaging even for users that don&rsquo;t want to run
NixOS but want to have the power of quickly customizing PHP to exactly their
needs for that specific application.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s say it again:</strong>
NixOS now has the single best PHP packaging that exists in terms of
flexibility, being reproducible and being minimalistic at the same time.</p>
