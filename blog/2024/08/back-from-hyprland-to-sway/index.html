<p>After a brief experiment with
<a href="/blog/2024/07/switching-to-hyprland/">Hyprland</a>, I&rsquo;m back to using Sway. My
experiment lasted less than a month, as I hoped Hyprland&rsquo;s window
selector would resolve my window-sharing woes.</p>
<p>It turns out it wasn&rsquo;t, because the first week back at work I had the
need to share a slideshow in full screen. Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if
you can select a window anymore. So my workarounds with Sway would
have worked in that use case while my Hyprland set up…  didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="detour-via-cosmic">Detour via Cosmic</h2>
<p><a href="https://system76.com/cosmic">System76 announced Cosmic</a> in an Alpha
version which seemed fun to experiment with. So I&rsquo;ve pulled in the
<a href="https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic">flake for Cosmic</a> to
try it out. It was fairly straightforward to set up, configure and
use. However it has some bugs (all known upstream) that I find hard to
accept for daily use. But it gave me some inspiration and ideas at
least for things I want to have in my desktop.</p>
<p>After experimenting with Cosmic, I decided to return to Sway, but not
without incorporating some of the ideas and inspirations I gained.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m not using Cosmic, I remain very impressed with the
work that System76 has done in terms of establishing and building a
new desktop environment for the modern Linux desktop.</p>
<h2 id="the-ultrawide-monitor-challenge-turned-sideways">The Ultrawide Monitor Challenge turned sideways?</h2>
<p>I was listening to a Linux Podcast named <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/35/">Linux
Matters</a> where they mentioned a computer
monitor named <a href="https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/ergo-monitors/28mq780-b/">LG
DualUp</a> and
tempted as I was… I got two of them for myself as well. So instead of
an Ultrawide challenge I now have an Ultratall challenge which isn&rsquo;t
much different from wide when it comes to screen sharing. However, I
do have pre-existing workarounds for that.</p>
<p>So now I have 2 monitors that both have the aspect ratio of <code>16:18</code>
and the resolution of <code>2560x2880</code>. So I basically have 2 QHD panels
above each other, per monitor. It&rsquo;s a glorious set up with a lot of
height for code and terminals.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades-to-my-sway-session">Upgrades to my Sway session</h2>
<h3 id="replaced-lightdm-with-greetd">Replaced lightdm with greetd</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve for a long time used lightdm, but I&rsquo;ve never actually managed to
log in through lightdm. Not sure why. However, that has very rarely
been a problem because I&rsquo;ve have had it set to auto login anyway
which has worked fine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of an upgrade to switch to a login manager that works
for me even though I haven&rsquo;t found any settings for auto login.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-configuration">Keyboard configuration</h3>
<p>While on Cosmic I never figured out if I could use my custom xkb
configuration file to configure my keyboard layout as I used to on
Sway. So I found out how to configure it as I want it using xkb
options instead.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">input &#34;type:keyboard&#34; {
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  xkb_layout us
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  xkb_model pc105
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  xkb_options compose:102,compose:sclk,ctrl:nocaps
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  xkb_variant dvorak
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The bit I was having a hard time to find was <code>compose:102</code> that maps
the &ldquo;Less Then, Greater Then, Pipe&rdquo; or LSGT button to Compose.</p>
<p>And with this I&rsquo;ve also found the option <code>console.useXkbConfig</code> in
NixOS to pick up the console keymap from the <code>services.xserver.xkb</code>
options so now my Caps Lock actually behaves as Control… even outside
the graphical environment.</p>
<h3 id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to unify applications around the
<a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a> theme, it may be a bit pastel
for me but it seems to have enough contrast. It&rsquo;s also nice and
consistent and it has a <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/nix">Nix Flake</a>
that helps a lot with the set up for different applications.</p>
<p>Now, the same theme is applied across the TTY, Plymouth (for unlocking
the disk), the greetd greeter, Sway, Waybar, and other applications.</p>
<h3 id="running-tray-things">Running tray things</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done fancy things such as making sure the following nice tray
programs is started and working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Manager Applet (home-manager:
<code>services.network-manager-applet.enable</code>)</li>
<li>Blueman Manager (home-manager: <code>services.blueman-applet.enable</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixing-my-swayidle">Fixing my swayidle</h3>
<p>Before I had <code>swayidle</code> configured to black the screen but not
actually suspend the computer… That&rsquo;s also fixed!</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-wpaperd">Setting up wpaperd</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve switched wall paper for like the first time in 4 years, so I&rsquo;ve
found some nice space images that fits on my new monitors without
stretching and then it rotates between a set of a bunch of images on
random rotation every 30 minutes. It&rsquo;s very pretty!</p>
<h3 id="music-player-control">Music player control</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading about the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS"><code>mpris</code></a> protocol and
<code>playerctl</code>, this was super easy to set
up. <code>services.playerctld.enable</code> and <code>services.mpris-proxy.enable</code> in
home-manager made it possible to control media players on my Linux
desktop with Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also managed to add this using the <code>mpris</code> module to <code>waybar</code>
which was super easy.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes I left Sway, for like 3 weeks, which set me on a journey for
change to land on a better and more fancy sway that does more of the
things that I didn&rsquo;t know that I wanted it to do.</p>
