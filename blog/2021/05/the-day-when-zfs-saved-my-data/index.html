<p>Today my work day didn&rsquo;t turn out the way I expected. It started like a
normal day, I woke up around the regular time, did my morning routine, sat at
my desk and started my work-issued laptop.</p>
<p>It booted up just fine, I connected it to my Ultrawide display, started going
through Slack and Email and catch up on some news while drinking my morning
tea and waking up.</p>
<p>Then after around an hour of work things started to hang up, most notably
Firefox totally froze up. I could launch a new terminal but not start <code>htop</code>,
I had a <code>htop</code> session in a terminal already because it&rsquo;s part of what I
usually have running. So I went there to look.</p>
<p>In my <code>htop</code> I had ever increasing load increasing with more than <code>1.0</code> in
load per second but nothing actually using any resources for real. Something
was definitely bad, probably with disk access. I tried to run <code>ls</code>, and it
just locked up.</p>
<p>Then I rebooted my laptop, started it up, the EFI took ages to show up and to
pass through to <code>systemd-boot</code>, but it eventually did, so the disk wasn&rsquo;t
fully dead. Then I went on to boot my system and the ZFS pool wouldn&rsquo;t import
and it said something along the lines that recovery would be possible but
that I would lose data.</p>
<p>This was the point where it got to me how bad it was.</p>
<h2 id="looking-up-how-bad-it-was">Looking up how bad it was</h2>
<p>So I took my personal laptop, set up a NixOS to create a NixOS live USB stick
since that supports ZFS. Booted it up. I could indeed import the ZFS pool. I
then scrubbed the pool to confirm how bad it was.</p>
<p>This was the output from <code>zpool status -v</code>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While doing this scrub I had my kernel spamming messages like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain"><span class="line"><span class="cl">[ 358.895359] blk_update_request: critical medium error, dev nvme0n1, sector

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="starting-to-recover">Starting to recover</h2>
<p>So obviously some of my Firefox state was damaged, no big deal, but my
snapshot created at 08:00 this morning was intact it seemed. So I managed to
do a ZFS send to back this snapshot up to my file server at home.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">zfs send zroot/home@zfs-auto-snap_frequent-2021-05-21-08h00 <span class="p">|</span> pv <span class="p">|</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    ssh my-user@my-home-server <span class="s1">&#39;cat &gt; backups/work/home-filesystem.zfs&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This took a while because it was 25G worth of data. Most of which is &ldquo;backed
up&rdquo; in terms of repositories on GitHub or in form of database dumps that I
can do again. Then I would lose all my shell history and some miscellaneous
files that were in neither of these places. I also didn&rsquo;t want to sort all of
these things out from scratch.</p>
<p>The transfer of this snapshot was successful.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-work-environment">Setting up a work environment</h2>
<p>As a temporary measure I&rsquo;ve imported my work NixOS modules on my private
laptop, then I got all utilities and tools needed to do my job. Sure still
needed some passwords and SSH-keys, but passwords I could get from the
password manager and SSH-keys could be added. So no biggie there.</p>
<p>Then I imported the ZFS snapshot that I&rsquo;ve managed to recover from the work
laptop onto a new ZFS filesystem in the ZFS pool on my private laptop and
changed my private laptops NixOS configuration to mount the work home folder
instead of the regular one.</p>
<p>A NixOS rebuild later and I was back in business except that I needed to
rebuild some docker containers and such.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways-from-today">Takeaways from today</h2>
<p>I need a real and proper backup strategy, I was damn aware that I didn&rsquo;t have
one and I was sure about that I wouldn&rsquo;t be as scared or sad if this sort of
thing would happen since &ldquo;most things are in git anyways&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This has proved to me that I need to set this up as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I was lucky that I had ZFS telling me so clearly what was wrong, how it was
wrong, what I could recover, what I couldn&rsquo;t recover so when I did recover my
data I&rsquo;m sure that I managed to recover every single bit of data that I cared
about backing up. If it wasn&rsquo;t for ZFS I&rsquo;m not sure that I would have noticed
as early as I did and I&rsquo;m not sure that I would have been able to save any of
the data.</p>
<p>Snapshots on the machine you use isn&rsquo;t a replacement for backups, but it&rsquo;s a
really good tool for creating backups based on.</p>
