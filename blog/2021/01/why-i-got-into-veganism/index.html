<p><img src="/blog/2021/01/why-i-got-into-veganism/metric-for-ethics.webp" alt="Metric for ethics"></p>
<p>This is a follow-up on: <a href="/blog/2021/01/why-i-use-free-software/">Why I use Free Software</a>. This has been followed up
by: <a href="/blog/2021/01/i-find-food-habits-at-free-software-events-weird/">I find food habits at Free Software events weird</a>.</p>
<p>People who turn to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#Ethical_veganism">Veganism</a> can do this for different reasons,
some do it for health reasons, others for climate reasons. But in it&rsquo;s core,
the Vegan movement in itself is an ethical movement about saving the animals.
The other reasons are more or less side effects.</p>
<p>When my journey to Veganism started I didn&rsquo;t get into Veganism at all to
begin with. I got into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism">Vegetarianism</a> because wanted to
challenge myself by forcing myself to change and experience a different
pallet of foods, but also for health reasons.</p>
<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve learned more about the ethical aspects of Veganism which
partly made me question the point of Vegetarianism and more towards ethical
Veganism. I still to this day don&rsquo;t know the point of Vegetarianism, not
after learning some of the horrible things that happens within the dairy
industry.</p>
<p>Before I became a Vegan I thought that I was doing something good for the
animals and the environment. How bad can milk be (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI">Youtube - Erin Janus - Dairy is scary!</a>)? How bad
can wool be (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTvjWE2aVw">Youtube - Erin Janus - Wool industry exposed</a>)? It also turns out that the best thing anyone
can do for the environment ([The Guardian: Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth][https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth])  is also the best thing for the animals.</p>
<p>Before I started this journey into Veganism I was the typical meat eating
guy. I even used to make inappropriate jokes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pig bacon on Cow burgers is good because that insures that at least two
different animals have died for this meal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a morbid joke back then, it hasn&rsquo;t aged well. I&rsquo;m also upset with
myself that I didn&rsquo;t learn and actually adopted Veganism as a lifestyle
earlier - but I know for a fact that I wouldn&rsquo;t listen, I know this because
my partner tried to convince me to drop milk earlier. I simply refused. I
believe that everyone have to get there in their own way in their own time
when they understand why.</p>
<p>So to conclude, for all the reasons stated here (and more), I find Veganism
to be the only reasonable lifestyle that is actually the only one that
doesn&rsquo;t have the intent to outsource murder in gas chambers (among other
methods) and rape to feed the murder.</p>
<p>Even though It&rsquo;s been many years since I got hooked on using <a href="/blog/2021/01/why-i-use-free-software/">Free Software</a>,
I&rsquo;ve now made the mental connection between Free Software and Veganism since
I&rsquo;ve found that they are surprisingly similar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some key differences though. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">Proprietary Software</a> usually doesn&rsquo;t involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing of billions of animals including using actual gas chambers.</li>
<li>Breed the animals to be able to kill them.</li>
<li>Produce toxic waste from having millions of sentient beings in the form of
feces that comes out in the water supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Veganism is the only humane lifestyle that isn&rsquo;t pushing for more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism">Speciesism</a>, which benefits both humans, animals and the
environment. Since Free Software is humane software, I can only conclude that
Free Software is Vegan software - but a less important issue due to the
victims that Veganism wants to protect.</p>
