<h2 id="my-history-with-coffee">My history with coffee</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been into coffee, every time I&rsquo;ve tried them as a child or young
adult they have been terrible. They have just been bitter and it&rsquo;s not a
taste profile I to this day enjoy at all.</p>
<p>I have, a couple of times encountered coffee that friends have made that
actually weren&rsquo;t that bitter. So my reaction to it has managed to reach the
level of &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t terrible&rdquo;. Not terrible isn&rsquo;t a great review though, not
really something that one gets back to right away.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-at-with-tea-though">Where am I at with tea though?</h2>
<p>I did learn to drink tea at a quite early age, with time I have developed
opinions about tea.</p>
<p>I have quite strong opinions about what bad tea is and I have opinions about
fancy tea.</p>
<h3 id="my-three-classifications-of-tea">My three classifications of tea</h3>
<h4 id="bad-tea">Bad tea</h4>
<ul>
<li>All tea that comes in small paper bags, it just tastes like paper</li>
<li>All tea that comes in big packs from Lipton</li>
<li>Most teas that doesn&rsquo;t have a name other than a color such as &ldquo;black&rdquo; or
&ldquo;green&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tea that smells more like perfume but tastes like nothing but hot water</li>
<li>Most versions of Earl Gray</li>
<li>Rooibos, it&rsquo;s not tea though, I just include it anyways</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fancy-tea">Fancy tea</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tea that requires highly specific timing and water temperature to be
drinkable at all.</li>
<li>Matcha tea.</li>
<li>Gunpowder tea.</li>
<li>Tea that tastes like algae.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="good-tea">Good tea</h4>
<p>I have some specific favorites like everyone, I mostly drink black teas,
often with some fruit flavoring from the local tea store.</p>
<p>If I want to get fancy, I do order &ldquo;Earl Gray Assam Gold&rdquo; from the Stockholm
tea store &ldquo;In the mood for tea&rdquo;. While most earl gray tastes bitter, their
Earl Gray actually tastes what it&rsquo;s supposed to taste: Bergamot.</p>
<p>However, I tend to not go more into the fancy field than that. I&rsquo;ve, at best
managed to drink some fancy tea that has been prepared by people who I trust
in preparing them properly. My reaction has always, at best been that I…
maybe manage to drink it at all. Mostly I think it tastes like algea and that
is… to me not a great thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-cultural-dominance-of-coffee">The cultural dominance of coffee</h2>
<p>In Swedish society there&rsquo;s a huge dominance of coffee in the culture. This
also means that there&rsquo;s a whole lot of convenience around coffee with a lot
of infrastructure built to deliver coffee to people everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also built into the culture, if you&rsquo;re meeting up with some colleges
that you haven&rsquo;t seen for a long time. The default question for most people
is to do so over a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>As a tea drinker you&rsquo;re often the &ldquo;odd one out&rdquo; in most cases. There&rsquo;s just a
whole lot more coffee out there as a cultural norm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of seasonal coffee drinks at cafés that contain coffee,
drinks that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to try out that has been ruined by the coffee
that they contain.</p>
<h3 id="so-can-i-get-used-to-coffee">So can I get used to coffee?</h3>
<p>I know for a fact that the taste buds does change quite rapidly, if you do a
change, like reduce the amount of salt for 3 weeks, it will begin as bland
and within 3 weeks you&rsquo;ll get used to the lower salt contents and other
tastes will grow more clear to you.</p>
<p>So I started thinking, does this work for coffee?</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the cheapest and least effort way to try coffee?</strong></p>
<p>This is easy: The one you already have at home, which is instant coffee
that&rsquo;s expired the best before date that your father in law left at your
place over two years ago so there&rsquo;s some coffee at your place when he visits.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the best coffee?</strong></p>
<p>Probably not. That wasn&rsquo;t the point.</p>
<p><strong>So did you start drinking this?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes I did. It were absolutely terrible when I started. A week later it
was still terrible. However, a week in it was actually slightly less terrible
than when I started out.</p>
<p>And yes, I did drink it black at all times.</p>
<p><strong>What happened after a week?</strong></p>
<p>Well… I do like to read about nerdy things so I started on a Youtube track of
<em>James Hoffmann</em> and started to be interested in <em>Specialty Coffee</em>. So I did
order a grinder for like €190 and an Aeropress. This without even having any
beans at home.</p>
<p>Then I happened to go on a business trip and ended up at a restaurant with
some friends, they got to hear about my experiment and brought me to a coffee
café that also imports and roast their own beans. So I tried some coffee
there and it was pretty decent and suddenly I had paid €22 for 250g of coffee
beans at the <em>Drops Coffee</em> café. But you know, they were roasted just a
couple of days ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also bought some cheaper beans at a store to practice using my new
equipment on just to know how it works.</p>
<p>I did buy a tasting kit from <em>Drops Coffee</em> which is a great pack. I got 5
packs of 100g of different coffee for just €37.</p>
<h3 id="so-do-i-like-coffee-now">So do I like coffee now?</h3>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I seem to have an easier time to drink light roasted specialty coffees that
are in general quite light.</p>
<p>I have managed to drink espresso at cafés a couple of times and they have
been fine. Even at non-fancy cafés.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also managed to enjoy seasonal coffee drinks at cafés, which I guess was
part of the bigger goal.</p>
<p><strong>Will I continue to drink coffee now?</strong> I guess, I have all this fancy
equipment and a lot of expensive beans at home to drink. So I may actually
like this properly sooner or later.</p>
